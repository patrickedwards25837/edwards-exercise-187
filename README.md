This is a sales program for a sod business. It reads files to load inventory to arrays, then lets the user navigate menus in order to make a purchase. The purchase is then written to a file, and this process is repeated until program is closed. The program then reads the data written to file and outputs a report of purchases made followed by report counters and current stock.
